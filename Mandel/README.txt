This is the Mandel Series Program from CSE3320 with Trevor Bakker.

The code here will generate 50 BMP Mandel files. The purpose of this is to show
multithreading and multiprocessing. We will use 'gettimeofday' to measure execution times
and compare data by increasing the amount of threads and processes.

The code here is taken from Trevor Bakker and modified by Minh-Quan H. Nguyen.

Please note that use of this code is prohibited without permission from Mr. Bakker.
